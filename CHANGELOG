1.0.1:
- Moved the BlockBreak and BlockPlaceEvent to a separate class and re-wrote them to better support saving and removal
- Removed metadata code as it never got any use
- Moved command handling to a seperate class
- Recoded location matching for block removal to increase reliability
- MeetingStones can now have spaces in their names
- MeetingStones can no longer be "stacked" in the lore by spamming the create command
- The clear command has been slightly reworked to properly remove the lore
- Added color to messages and a perfix so they are not just a boring line of plain text
- Only players with permission may place/break MeetingStones (BUT PISTONS CAN STILL PUSH THE BLOCK!)
- Fixed a bug preventing block removal after a player has teleported to it (also caused an offset bug)

1.0.0:
- Initial Release. Most parts functional
